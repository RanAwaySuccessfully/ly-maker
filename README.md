# ly-maker a.k.a. Layout Maker XP
Layout Maker XP is a random thing I did for easy post layout making for SMWCentral. The code's here 'cause "why not?". [Functional version is over here](https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/26481/ly-maker.html), might be updated more oftenly than the code dump over here, dunno. I just realized I don't really like putting code over here, meh. Feel free to mess with it, do contact me before you decide to put it to any other use, etc. etc. etc. Not provided under a license currently because licenses are overrated.

Suggestions, bug reports, forks, pull requests and the like appreciated.
