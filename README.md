# ly-maker a.k.a. Layout Maker XP
Layout Maker XP is a tool written in JavaScript that facilitates layout making for people at SMWCentral. [Functional version is over here](https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/26481/ly-maker2.html). [Old version here](https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/26481/ly-maker.html). I can't guarantee that both will be kept up to date. This is here for easy viewing, as well as easy suggesting, bug reports, forks, pull requests, etc.

Contact me before you decide to host it or use it anywhere else on the internet. Not currently provided under a license because I don't really feel like a project this simple needs it.
