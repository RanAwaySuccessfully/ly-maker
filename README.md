# ly-maker a.k.a. Layout Maker XP
Layout Maker XP is a tool written in JavaScript that facilitates layout making for people at SMWCentral. [Functional version is over here](https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/26481/ly-maker2.html). [Old version here](https://bin.smwcentral.net/u/26481/ly-maker.html). I can't guarantee that both will be kept up to date. This is here for easy viewing, as well as easy suggesting, bug reports, forks, pull requests, etc.
